For the v3 project, define separate implementation phases to satisfy the requirements in @spark_isaac_mycobot_v3/spec.md .

If Residual RL makes sense in this context create an additional phase for this work.

Also define phase(s) for testing on a physical MyCobot 280 M5 arm.

Obtain the resources needed for IsaacSim simulation, copying from the V2 project if applicable.

## BEGIN: 2026-07-18 18:45 -0700
I am going to create a new version of this project, located in the spark_isaac_mycobot_v3 directory.

Notice the existence of an existing spec.md and @spark_isaac_mycobot_v3/.cursor directory (equivalent to .cursorrules) in this directory.

Perform the following steps to bootstrap this project:

- Determine the files that would be most useful for a new version of this project. The new project will have different requirements and a different design.

- Copy these file into the new project directory @/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src/spark_isaac_mycobot_v3/. If the same or related files exist in the new project directory consider the content of the new files to be primary and use it to replace any conflicting content you find in the files from the previous version.

- Use your own judegement when determining what content from the previous version to omit. If you find certain content would be useful with modifications, then perform those modifications and document appropriately.

- Project documents that relate to current status should be created new and initialized for this new version.

- Push this project to github in a wip_phase0 branch. Leave the main branch empty for now, since it will be reserved for releases.

Failure drill-down + handoff/far-tip fix

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

I aborted this iteration because it is not clear that convergence is possible with the current approach. Instead I would prefer the following:

Examine each failed test since the beginning and label the failure. Create a table showing the frequency of each type of error identified and display it a separate subagent window. Return to the main agent, and start with the most common failure and work to resolve this failure before moving on to the next. Essentially drill down into each type of failure one-at-time. Adjust the testing criteria as needed so only the one particular failure case being addressed is tested.

Once a particular issue is resolved, commit the change and push to wip_change3 on github. Then move to the next most common issue and perform the same process, again limiting test coverage to the issue in question.

Once all issues have been addressed then reenable all verification tests, and attempt a full GUI test. A passing success rate this time, is .95 or higher.

Before you begin work described above, fix the following bug identified in past tests:

"handoff/far-tip bug"

Contact approach: spheres, tip-omit, and alternatives

## BEGIN: 2026-07-17 12:42 -0700
The arm motion on visual inspection is still problematic:

The EE collides with the target from the sides and back, before the surface of the EE is aligned with the target. It seems deactivating the collision spheres in the final approach has caused a different problem.

The use of collision spheres does not seem to be working, and it is computationally heavy since it realizes on IK to formulate a path.

Is there another alternative? Are collision spheres required to assure that other parts of the arm (non EE parts) do *not* collide with the sphere on approach?

Monitor the progress of the GUI test and abort it early if the target is not reached in a few episodes.

Some collision spheres do not appear near the contour of the arm. Could this be the reason for the failed GUI tests?

Elaborate on this:

" inflate only for spheres-ON approach; tip-omit uses the visual radius; keep standoff and tip-omit allow in lockstep (~12–15 mm or raise allow with standoff). That split is already partly started in recovery.py."

What does this mean in terms of the kinematics of movement?

## BEGIN: 2026-07-17 10:40 -0700
In the visualization, I still see the target colliding with the side of the arm before reaching the EE.

Also, the EE is not touching the surface of the taget sphere. It is colliding with it.

When are via's used to reach the target, versus declaring the target unreachable? A target should only be declared unreachable if it is outside the dexterous region.

Is cuRobo the right IK to use? Would it make more sense to use the oracle IK and replace cuRobo, if it converges more consistently?
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-17 10:23 -0700
The number of skip_unreachable target's is too high. Add a testing gate for an unacceptably high percentage of unreachable targets.

If a target is unreachable it should not be included in the overall count of episodes.

Can you verify that only targets which do no passs through the arm in some way before reaching the contact surface of the EE, are considered a success? In other words, no part of the arm should make contact with the surface of target except the EE and should be considered a test failure if it does.

Also contact with the target by the EE, should occur in the middle of the contact area of the EE and only the surface of the target. Verify that this is clearly indicated in @spec.md .

The last two paragraphs have been an issue before (see @docs/last_prompt.md . Is this a regression?

When a push to github occurs several files are generally left out, such as last_prompt.md, STATUS.md, and CHANGES.md. Since these are the last files to be updated and are often updated with the status of the push to github, a secondary push to github should occur in a manner that does not cause the yet another update to these files.

Why do the headless tests results produce fewer failures than the GUI test?

Would it make sense to incorporate (created from scratch or by using an existing library) a standalone replacement for cuRobo IK that is implenented with a deep learning network of some type? Or would this be a step backward in deterministic results? Are there better IK libraries that we should consider?

Implement all three recommended next steps.

Add this requirement to spec.md: At the end of each test analyze the logs and look for occurences of "SKIPPED_UNREACHABLE". Speculate on why this was the result for a particular episode. If the target was still within the "Dexterous Region" then speculate on a different approach to generate a via that supports a deterministic IK calculation and include in the prompt output and in STATUS.md .

## END

## BEGIN: 2026-07-16 23:06 -07:00
The target is approached from the wrong side of the EE, causing the need for an alternate approach using a via.

When the target collides with the side of the EE, it makes contact with the surface of the EE from the inside of the EE surface, and incorrectly reports success.

Can you monitor for this condition and report a failure, even if the target turns green? I would recommend formulating a mathematical expression that evaluates the repeated need for vias in consecutive episodes.

Use the strict 1.0 gate on a short GUI test, and iterate until targets are approached from the correct angle and contact made from the correct side of the EE.
## END

## BEGIN: 2026-07-16 22:05 -07:00
The IK path frequently approaches the target from the wrong side of the EE. It occasionally moves through the red sphere and records this as a success (color changes to green). Also, when the EE is close to the target the number of retries is consistently high.

Instrument the code to detect these conditions.

Iterate until the intended code changes listed below are successful:

- Approach-axis pose goal — plan the final segment along the EE tip normal (tool +Z) into the pierce point, with orientation constrained so the pad faces the sphere.

- Keep tip spheres on until a short final contact nudge
## END

## BEGIN: 2026-07-16 21:43 -07:00
The problem does not appear resolved.  I would reduce the duration of the test to save time, since the error is apparent after the first few tests.

Continue to iterate until the GUI test is passes a few tests, then extend to a longer number of tests when the problem appears resolved.

Explore /workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src/spark_isaac_mycobot_v2 for how Phase 2 contact planning works so we can implement:

1. Approach-axis pose goal: plan final segment along EE tip normal (tool +Z) into pierce point with orientation constrained so pad faces sphere.
2. Keep tip spheres ON until a short final contact nudge: collision-free approach to a standoff, then short axial move with tip spheres omitted.

Focus on these files and related helpers:
- src/residual_adaptive_ik/planning/recovery.py
- src/residual_adaptive_ik/planning/curobo_planner.py
- isaac_sim/run_ik_viz.py
- isaac_sim/target_marker.py
- configs/planning/collision.yaml
- Any FK that returns orientation / tip frame
- Existing omit_tip_links / contact_planner / plan_to_pose / surface approach logic

Return:
1. Current contact-leg flow (direct + via) with key function names and what omit_tip_links does
2. Whether FK/pose API already exposes tip orientation / tool frame
3. Best insertion points for standoff-then-axial-nudge and tool-axis approach
4. Config knobs that should be added
5. Existing tests that will need updates
6. Concrete implementation sketch (files + functions to change)

I have been reviewing the changes made in wip_phase2 and I am conerned about the change to start every episode with a return to home. Yes, it increases the likelihood of successfully completing the test, but it fails to capture the use case where multiple IK targets will need to be reached, without returning to home. Add the latter use case to @v2 residual IK (active)/spec.md .

Is there a strategy that would support the repositioning of the arm in preparation for an IK calculation when the IK calculation fails? The current approach of just randoming selecting a position farther away from the target may not be adequate. Can you examine the pattern of practice when performing IK in this scenario by reading existing sample code and research papers?

# Old prompts:

## BEGIN: 2026-07-15 14:56 -07:00
IMPORTANT CORRECTION FROM THE USER:

A trial that gets PLAN_OK but MARKER_NO_CONTACT must be counted as a **failure**, not a success. The current implementation only logs a warning for MARKER_NO_CONTACT and still counts it as PLAN_OK for the rate gate. This is wrong.

**Requirement:** Success for each test must include contact with the surface of the sphere from the EE surface. If the tip never reaches the sphere surface (MARKER_NO_CONTACT), that trial must count as a failure for the pass/fail gate.

Specifically:
1. In `isaac_sim/run_ik_viz.py`, when `MARKER_NO_CONTACT` occurs (PLAN_OK but tip never reached sphere surface), the trial must be reclassified: either decrement `n_plan_ok` and increment `n_plan_fail`, or add a separate contact gate that also must pass (e.g., `n_contact_green` must equal `n_plan_ok`).
2. Update any tests that assert on the gate logic to reflect this new requirement.
3. Update docs (STATUS.md, phase2_status_and_resume.md, phase2_geometry.md) to document that surface contact is required for a trial to count as successful.

After implementing this fix, continue with the previous prompt which was:
- If all tests pass including GUI test, commit and push to wip_phase2
- Rebase and push to main, create wip_phase3 branch
- If tests fail, iterate on the fix
- Document in STATUS.md

# Old prompts:

## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 23:01 -07:00
When viewing the test results in the GUI, the yellow targets change position, but the arm remains motionless. No recovery strategy is attempted. Can you add headless tests to detect this condition?
## END

## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 22:53 -07:00
Yes, please rename and update as needed.
## END

## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 22:52 -07:00
Why does the name of the testing script refere to phase1? Aren't we working on Phase 2?
## END

## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 22:50 -07:00
Can you make a CLI option for reset to home?
## END

## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 22:47 -07:00
Make the return to a home position a parameterized option that is disabled by default. I would like to test recovery strategies for path planning.

If the plan is failing, keep trying using the recover strategies discussed. Timeout after a certain duration.

Yes, implement standoff via the approach that is provides the most reliable recovery strategy (via waypoints?).

Does Moveit 2 do a better job than cuRobo in this context?
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 22:37 -07:00
Can you return the arm to an intial position at the beginning of each test? I am assuming this will produce fewer plan failures.

Can you suggest a strategy for coping with motion planning failures in a more general context. Would it make sense to move the EE to a different position and retry the creation of a new path? If so, where would the arm move in this scenario? Is this an aspect of path planning where the creation of an intermediate waypoint in proximity to the target would allow path planning to succeed?

Is there reseach or existing ROS2 or Nvidia libraries that have support for such scenarios? Is this another aspect of Residual Learning?
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 22:25 -07:00
Can you create a unit test that could find bugs of this type in the future?

Also, can you change the color of the ball to yellow when path planning fails?

Is it possible to stream the debug output appearing in the host console to an IsaacSim window?
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 22:21 -07:00
In this case the arm consistently moves the EE and colides with the marker, even when a planning failure is indicated.
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 22:01 -07:00
I still see the target sphere making contact with the side of the EE.

Can you produce additional diagnotic code to verify this in headless mode? Watching the outcome in GUI mode is time consuming.
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 21:51 -07:00
The marker may still pass through the side of the EE when approaching the end of the EE.

Can you verify that the volume of the target (aka "marker) is indeed being procesed by cuRobo?
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 21:36 -07:00
I was detecting self-collision when watching the EE approach the target. The target passed through sections of the EE as it made it's final approach.

To be more realistic, the 3D target should not be processed as a point, but as a sphere with volume, and the EE should not collide with the sphere even if the center of the sphere clears the surface of EE.

Replace the spheres with the cuRobot sphere fitting from the mesh, as recommended in item 3.

## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 18:41 -07:00
I noticed when IsaacSim visualization was running that the arm collided with the ground. Would the trajectory planning prevent this as well?

Complete the implementation of Phase 2 to provide all required features. Use cuRobot for collision free trajectories.

Commit, rebase, and push when successful.
## END

## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 18:38 -07:00
Would the use of cuRobo still work with ROS 2 when commanding the physical arm?
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 18:27 -07:00
Update all relevant documentation with the current project status. Indicate which phase is completed and what are next steps.

Commit and push the existing code to the git hub repo. Rebase and push into the remote repo main branch. Use a verbose commit message.

Once this is done, create a new branch called wip_phase2. Then begin work on the "4-phase renumber". Use Nvidia libraries (as long as they are considered open source) or ROS libraries, and use your own judgement regarding which is more appropriate for this project.

Iterate on the changes you make, fixing bugs/warnings as needed, and add additional tests for CI and Spark based testing as needed.

Review the code and existing docuemntation for a level of inline documentation that maximizes its tutorial-quality. Update spec.md and/or .cursorrules to enforce this standard.

When you are successful:

- Commit the changes to the local and remote repo.
- Update all relevant documentation, especially STATUS.md to describe what was completed.
- Provide a command to run the run the IssacSim in GUI mode and see the resulting arm movement.

During the implementation of residual IK will testing on hardware be required in order to process the feedback on motor position when actual position varies from that commanded by the IK?
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 18:10 -07:00
Regarding this statement: "Avoid making MoveIt/cuRobo replace residual IK as the deployed brain."

Is this even possible? I was imagining that residual IK does something that MoveIt/cuRobo cannot do.

## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 18:03 -07:00
Should we define a Phase 2 (and renumber the other Phases) to describe the implementation of geometry and planning?

If so, would it make sense to use a more full-featured IK implementation to meet this requirement and what would you recommend?

Can you elaborate on this statement "If you want true arm–obstacle avoidance later, that needs a separate geometry/path layer (not classical DLS alone)."
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 17:50 -07:00
Is there anything in the IK that assures that the EE or any other part of the arm does not colide with the target 3D point as the EE is moving into position?

Many warnings appear as IsaacSim is being launched. Can you address each one, and if they should be ignored, state why? If an IsaaacSim warning should be ignored, document this in a special section of README.md.
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 17:37 -07:00
Modify the color of the ball to appear red until contact is made. Once contact is made change the color to greeen.

Also increase the number of points the number of separate target 3D points to allow for more thorough testing.
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 17:30 -07:00
Can you create a script that clearly delineates the tests to be run on the host versus for CI on a remote repo?

Should there be something in .cursorrules that indicates which script should be run and when, or is this for spec.md?

Why wasn't the GUI test run automatically after the CI tests passed?

Also, what test was skipped in "40 passed, 1 skipped"?

## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 17:19 -07:00
For GUI testing, make the simulated servoes move in speeds that are the same as that of the real arm?

Modify the tests to make sure that the 3D points used as the IK target are distributed evenly around the space of the maximum range of the arm. This was also a requirement in V1, so my may want to look there for a reference.

Can you document all of the libraries used for implementation of Phase 1 and describe how they were used in @v2 residual IK (active)/README.md . Update @v2 residual IK (active)/REFERENCES.md as well. Update spec.md and/or .cursorrules, if needed, to require this step for all applicable changes.

As was done in V1, can you highlight the target point in 3D space with a small red sphere?

Also, can you provide the command I would need to run the GUI test manually, but for at least a few minutes of runtime?
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 17:04 -07:00
Nice work! Can you run the CI tests, and then the host GUI version of the tests?
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 17:01 -07:00
Is there a way for you to run the GUI testing after a change, without my manual intervention? Can you use nsenter with a non-root UID? I believe that the "v1 demo" project did just that.
## END


## BEGIN: 2026-07-11 16:58 -07:00
Okay, I agree.

However, performing GUI testing should be required after CI tests have completed successfully *and* you are running on a system equipped with IsaacSIM. The idea is that only CI testing would be run for verification of a PR processed on a remote github repo, but full GUI testing would occur when engaged in develpment on a DGX Spark host machine.
